<%= @volunteer.user.name %> just volunteered for <%= @volunteer.volunteer_role.name %>.

Visit <%= event_volunteer_role_volunteers_url(@volunteer.volunteer_role.event, @volunteer.volunteer_role) %> to see their details and contact them.

Please contact them as soon as possible, and then mark them as 'contacted' on the members area so that we know that you have. This will help us keep track of which roles still need to be filled, so we might chase you otherwise! If you have any questions, reach out to the Volunteers Team via volunteers@londondecom.org.

Thanks,
Volunteer Team, London Decompression
